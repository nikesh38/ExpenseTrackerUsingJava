üìÅ Project Structure (Explained in Words)

The project is organized into the following main folders and files:

src/
This is the root source folder containing all the Java source files, organized into packages:

dao/ ‚Äì This package contains the data access layer:

ExpenseDAO.java ‚Äì Contains methods to perform database operations like insert, update, delete, and fetch expenses.

ExpenseDAO.class ‚Äì The compiled version of ExpenseDAO.java.

model/ ‚Äì Contains the business logic or data model:

Expense.java ‚Äì Defines the Expense object with properties like amount, category, date, etc.

Expense.class ‚Äì The compiled class file.

ui/ ‚Äì This package manages the user interface:

ExpenseTrackerUI.java ‚Äì Handles the GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Java Swing.

ExpenseTrackerUI.class ‚Äì The compiled UI class.

util/ ‚Äì Utility classes, mainly for database setup:

DBConnection.java ‚Äì Provides a reusable method to connect to the MySQL database.

DBConnection.class ‚Äì The compiled connection class.

Main.java ‚Äì The main entry point of the program which starts the UI.

Main.class ‚Äì The compiled version of Main.java.

TestConnection.java ‚Äì An optional test class to check if the database connection is working.

TestConnection.class ‚Äì The compiled test class.

lib/

Contains external libraries required for the project.

Specifically: mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar ‚Äì The MySQL JDBC driver used for database connectivity.

Expensetrackeruibased.iml

IntelliJ IDEA project module file, which stores project-specific configurations.



üß© MySQL Database Setup

Open your SQL tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench).

Run the following SQL:

-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ExpenseTrackerDB;

-- Use the database
USE ExpenseTrackerDB;

-- Create the expenses table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS expenses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

In DBConnection.java, update your MySQL credentials:
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ExpenseTrackerDB";
private static final String USER = "your_mysql_username";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile & Run

1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up classpath

Ensure you reference the MySQL connector in your classpath when compiling and running. Example:

# Compile
javac -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar" src/**/*.java

# Run
java -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar;src" Main

Use : instead of ; on Linux/macOS:
javac -cp ".:lib/mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar" src/**/*.java
java -cp ".:lib/mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar:src" Main
